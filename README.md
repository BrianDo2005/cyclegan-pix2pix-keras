# cyclegan-pix2pix-keras
A [Keras](keras.io) implementation of CycleGAN and pix2pix based on [junyanz/CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) and [junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix). This code tries to hold to the practices outlined in the other repositories, but may have slight differences or extra options that came up in the process of adapting to Keras or testing out features.
